        <h1><b>Chapter 2,3, and 4</b></h1>
        <p>CHAP 2 NOTES<br> -There are two ways to create comments in javascript, using '//' and '/*' <br> -It is best to put semicolons at the end of a statemnet even though it is not needed <br> -These words are reserved and cannot be used for variables:
            abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, <br> class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in, instanceof,
            int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield <br> -Also avoid
            using: undefined, NaN, Infinity <br>
            <br> GOOD ARRAY TOOLS<br> -There is a special operator called 'typeof' this finds the type of a value<br> -Using let or const sets variables on a local scope in javascript<br> -Give variables sensible names<br> -const myArray = [];<br> -To
            assign to an array use myArray[0] = 1<br> -Arrays can be filled with any type of variable<br> -to delete things from an array use the 'delete' feature<br> -delete myArray[0];<br> -to find a length of an array use myArray.length (this is useful
            for loops)<br>
            <br> ARRAY FUNCTIONS<br> -use pop() to remove the last item in an array<br> -use shift() to remove the first item in an array<br> -use push() to push a new value onto an array<br> -use unshift() to put a new item on the beginning of an array<br>            -use concat() to merge arrays together<br> -use join() to turn the array into a string that includes all items in the array and lists them<br> -you can also use myArray followed by a . and the desired function for all of the previously mentioned
            functions
            <br> -use slice() to create a sub array<br> -use reverse() to reverse the order of the arrays<br> -use sort() to sort the order of an array<br> -You can find out if an array contains a particular value using the indexOf()<br> -multidimensional
            arrays are essentially arrays of arrays<br>
            <br> SETS
            <br> -a set is a data structure that has a collection of unique values<br> -create a set by using 'const list = new Set();'<br> -use list.add(1) to add values to the set<br> -to add separate words use the .add() for each additional word<br>            -use the .size() to find the size of a set(this is useful for loops)<br> -.has() checks for a value in the set<br> -.delete() removes values from the set<br> -there are strong and weak sets, weak sets can only contain non-primitive data types<br>
            <br> MAPS
            <br> -maps are a data structure that contain data with an accompying key<br> -.set() adds a key and value to a map <br> -.get() looks up a value using the key <br> -.has() checks for a specific key in a map <br> -.delete() can be used to delete
            keys from the map <br> -.clear() removes all keys and values from the map <br> -weak maps cannot have primitive data types<br>
            <br> FUNCTIONS
            <br> -'const square = x => x*x;' This is also known as an arrow function<br> -The arrow function cuts down on typing<br> -You can hoist functions and variables wich means that you cna move them to being first in order rather than last
