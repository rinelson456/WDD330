            -Forms are made up of a
            < 'form'> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons. <br> - The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically.<br> -The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values
                specified in the HTML. <br> -The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server. <br> -The focus event occurs when an element is focused on. <br> -The
                blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.
                <br> -The change event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it. <br> - we can use JavaScript to intercept the form before it’s sent by adding a submit event listener<br> -Some common types of form
                control are:<br> -
                < 'input'> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads <br> -
                    < 'select'> menus for drop-down lists of options <br> -
                        < 'textarea'> elements for longer text entry<br> -
                            < 'button'> elements for submitting and resetting forms<br><br> -input type='password' is used to enter passwords or secret information.<br> -Radio buttons are created using input fields with type='radio'. <br> -Object-oriented programming
                                is often used to model representations of objects in the real world. <br> -Polymorphism means various objects can share the same method. <br> -using actual objects as the blueprint for creating more objects. This is known
                                as a prototypebased language.<br> - All objects have a constructor property that returns the constructor function that created it:<br> -The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method.<br>                                -The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared.<br> -By default, an object’s methods are public in JavaScript.<br> -
