            -The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen<br> - In a browser environment, the global object is the window object. This means that any
            global variable created is actually a property of the window object<br> -The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box.<br> -The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the
            program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel.<br> -The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message
            provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text.<br> -The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The Navigator object contains information about the browser
            being used.<br> -The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page.<br> -The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used<br> -The host property returns a string describing
            the domain of the current URL and the port number<br> -The hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL:
            <br> -The port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL:<br> -The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain<br>            -The search property returns a string that starts with a '?' followed by the query string parameters.<br> -The hash property returns a string that starts with a "#" followed by the fragment identifier.
            <br> -The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from.<br> -The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter<br> -The replace() method
            is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button.<br> -The toString() method returns a string containing the
            whole URL<br> -The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session.<br> -There are also the window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be
            used to navigate forwards and backwards by one page<br> -The close() method can be used to close a window, assuming you have a reference to it<br> -Every time a value is saved to local storage, a storage event is fired<br> -The Geolocation
            API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.<br> -The position object passed to the youAreHere() function has a coords property with a latitude and longitude property, <br> -
